# Python Object-Oriented Programming


![Python Object-Oriented Programming][lil-thumbnail-url] 

The object-oriented programming (OOP) features in Python make it easier to build programs of increasing complexity and modularity. In this course with instructor Joe Marini, learn how to apply core OOP principles to build programs that are extensible and efficient. Joe starts with the basics of defining and using classes and objects. Then he moves into more advanced features like abstract base classes and how to implement interfaces. He also details some of the more unique features of Python, like magic class methods to make your classes integrate tightly with the Python language and data classes to dramatically reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to build data-centric objects.

## Instructions
This repository contains two folders for the contents of the course:
- *Finished*: The fully finished versions of the code examples. Intended to be used as a reference and for help with troubleshooting your own code
- *Start*: The starting point for each exercise. This is the code that you will use in the course to build towards the finished examples.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files locally on your computer, you must have the following installed:
	- [Python][python-download]
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.

## Codespace
This course has been set up to use Codespaces, an online development environment that requires no installation. Fork a copy of the repository in your own Github account and use a Codespace to work entirely online.
